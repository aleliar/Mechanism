# Mechanism
1.Mechanism for Combustor-CFD

2.n-Dodecane is a 54-species mechanism from Yao(cite it while using it), which has format problems for OpenFOAM.

3.Formula of fuel is NC12H26 and methylene is pronounced as CH2*.

4.In n-Dodecane-Corrected, the formula of fuel is C12H26 and methylene is pronounced as CH2Y.

5. In n-Dodecane-Optimized, it is a global mechanism optimized to the same ignition time with Yao's skeletal mechanism
